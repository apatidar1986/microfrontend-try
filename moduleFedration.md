Module Federation is not always necessary for every micro-frontend architecture, but it is a powerful tool that solves many common challenges in micro-frontend implementations. Let's discuss this in more detail:

Module Federation is not always needed:

    For simpler micro-frontend architectures, you can use other approaches like:
        iframes
        Web Components
        Server-side composition
        Runtime integration via JavaScript

When Module Federation is beneficial:

    When you want to share code between micro-frontends efficiently
    For dynamic loading of micro-frontends at runtime
    To avoid duplication of dependencies across micro-frontends
    When you need fine-grained control over how modules are shared and loaded

Pros of using Module Federation:

    Better performance through shared dependencies
    More flexible loading strategies
    Easier code sharing between micro-frontends
    Better encapsulation of micro-frontend internals

Cons of using Module Federation:

    Increased complexity in setup and configuration
    Requires using Webpack (or a similar bundler that supports module federation)
    Can be overkill for simpler applications
